# ParkSmart
ParkSmart sources under GitHub

This is the source code for an iOS Parking app that gives the user reminders and walking directions to avoid a parking ticket. 
The unique feaure is that user only needs to take a picture of the parking stub and the app reads the stub and sets up a 
reminder.
